I saw a beautiful flower in the morning light. I aimed my ever-ready camera and said, "**Dance, Flower.**" but the flower did not dance. "**Sing, Flower.**" but the flower did not sing. "**Please, Flower... do something!**" and that's when I heard the words ofSean O'Connell from the movie _The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty,_ "**Beautiful things don't ask for attention.**" So I took the pic and edited the crap out of it.
