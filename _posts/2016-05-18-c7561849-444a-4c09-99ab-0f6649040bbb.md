I saw a beautiful flower in the morning light. I aimed my ever-ready camera and said,

"Dance, Flower" but the flower did not dance.

"Sing, Flower" but the flower did not sing.

"Pease, Flower... do something!" and that's when I heard the words of 

**Sean O'Connell from the movie**

The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty,

"Beautiful things don't ask for attention."

So I took the pic and edited the crap out of it.
