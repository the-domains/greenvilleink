I saw a beautiful flower in the morning light. I aimed my ever-ready camera and said,

"Dance, Flower" but the flower did not dance.

"Sing, Flower" but the flower did not sing.

"Please, Flower... do something!" and that's when I heard the words ofSean O'Connell from the movie The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty, "Beautiful things don't ask for attention." 

So I took the pic and edited the crap out of it.
