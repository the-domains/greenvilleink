title: "I saw a beautiful flower in the morning light. I aimed my ever-ready camera and said, \"Dance, Flower\" but the flower did not dance. \"Sing, Flower\" but the flower did not sing. \"Pease, Flower... do something!\" and that's when I heard the words of Sean O'Connell from the movie The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty, \"Beautiful things don't ask for attention.\" So I took the pic and edited the crap out of it."
